# Dark Patterns (Formerly "Project Dark Implicit")
Dark Patterns was a prototype for a mobile edutainment game intended to teach users about dark patterns (https://www.darkpatterns.org/). 
Powered by Unity, following a lesson that explicitly identifies a number of patterns, users would then have to complete a task on a mock website that employs these patterns, flagging instances of them along the way.
This game was initally meant to be entered for a co-op opportunity with MAGIC Studios at RIT. The future of this project is currently unknown.
